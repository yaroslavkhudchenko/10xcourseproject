description: >
  Audit an existing codebase for code logic that hides production errors:
  swallowed exceptions, errors turned into redirects or 200s, lost stack
  traces and causes, code paths running outside the error tracker, logs that
  never become alerts. Picks the critical user flows from
  context/foundation (shape-notes, PRD, roadmap) or asks for 2-3 areas,
  fans out full-stack subagent audits, optionally proves gaps at runtime
  with a local fake error-tracker endpoint, and writes a new dated report
  under context/audits/observability/ on every run. Use whenever the user
  asks why production errors are missing or hard to debug, wants an
  observability / monitoring / error-tracking / logging audit, asks "what
  does Sentry (or Datadog, Rollbar, CloudWatch…) miss", "audyt
  observability", "czego nie widzimy w monitoringu", or wants to re-run a
  previous observability audit. Tech-stack agnostic.

# Observability Audit: where do production errors disappear?

The goal is one question, asked per critical user flow: **when this breaks in
production, will anyone find out, and will they be able to tell why?**

Most codebases fail that test in a handful of systemic ways, not in hundreds
of unrelated places. Some code paths run outside the error tracker's scope.
Failures come back as ordinary responses. Error objects are dropped at the
first `catch`. Privacy filters remove the diagnostic data. Deploys aren't
labelled. The audit's job is to find those mechanisms, show the concrete
places where they hurt the flows that matter, and prove the worst of them.
It doesn't produce a lint-style list of every empty `catch`.

The skill never modifies the audited code in the main working tree. It
writes one new report per run. Runtime proof happens only in a throwaway
isolated copy.

## When to use, when to skip

**Use when** the project has code running in production (or about to) and
the user suspects errors are invisible, noisy or undiagnosable. Also use
before a launch, after an incident where "we had no logs", or to re-check
an earlier audit.

**Skip when** the user wants to fix one specific known error: that is
normal debugging. Also skip when they want to *choose* a monitoring vendor
(`/10x-infra-research`) or run a general project health check
(`/10x-health-check`).

## Inputs

- **Foundation docs (optional, preferred):** `context/foundation/shape-notes.md`,
  `context/foundation/prd.md`, `context/foundation/roadmap.md`. They tell you
  which flows matter to users and the business, so the audit spends its
  budget there.
- **Arguments (optional):** area names (e.g. `login checkout "admin import"`)
  override area selection. `--runtime` opts into runtime proof without
  asking. `--verify <report>` re-checks an earlier report's findings instead
  of hunting for new ones (see *Verify mode*).
- **Previous reports (optional):** `context/audits/observability/*.md`.

## Workflow

Track the steps with TaskCreate/TaskUpdate. The audit is long, and the user
should see where it is.

### Step 0 — Preconditions and run identity

1. Confirm cwd is a codebase (project manifest, source dirs). If not, stop
   and say so.
2. Record the run identity. Every report is anchored to exactly what was
   audited, which is what makes reruns comparable:
   - date and time (`date +%Y-%m-%d_%H%M`), current commit
     (`git rev-parse --short HEAD`), branch, and whether the tree is dirty
     (`git status --porcelain`). A dirty tree is fine, but say so in the
     report.
3. List earlier reports: `ls context/audits/observability/ 2>/dev/null`.
   Read the frontmatter of the most recent one (areas covered, commit,
   open findings). You will use it in Step 2 and Step 6.

### Step 1 — Discover the observability stack

Before auditing flows, build a **capture model**: a short, evidence-backed
description of how a failure travels from code to a human. Do this yourself
(it needs judgement, and it is small). Cite file:line for every claim.

- **Runtime and platform:** long-running server, serverless/edge functions,
  containers, mobile, browser SPA, SSR framework, background workers, cron,
  queues.
- **Error tracker:** Sentry, Datadog, Rollbar, Bugsnag, Honeybadger, New
  Relic, OpenTelemetry exporter, Application Insights, Crashlytics, or none.
  Find *every* init site and note what each one covers.
- **Capture boundaries:** where does the tracker actually get a live client?
  Global process handler, per-request middleware, per-route wrapper,
  framework integration, exception filter, error boundary. The central
  question is **which code paths execute outside any boundary**. Examples:
  middleware ordered before the tracker, routes that opt out, streamed
  response bodies, background tasks after the response, worker processes
  without their own init, the client-side app.
- **Logging:** the logger(s), where the logs go (platform log service, file,
  stdout), whether log lines ever become alerts or issues, and how the
  logger serializes error objects.
- **Scrubbing and sampling:** `beforeSend`-style hooks, PII filters, sample
  rates, ignore lists, log head-sampling.
- **Deploy identity:** release/version and environment tags; source maps or
  debug symbols; whether preview/staging traffic is distinguishable from
  production.

Put the capture model in the report. The subagents also need it, so they
don't each rediscover it.

### Step 2 — Pick the areas (the flows that matter)

Choose **2–4 critical user flows**, each audited full-stack (UI → API →
services → data/external calls → background work). Resolve them in this
order:

1. **Arguments:** use them as given.
2. **Foundation docs:** read the three files that exist. Pick the flows
   whose failure would hurt most: the core value loop (the thing users come
   for), identity/access (login, signup, permissions), money or irreversible
   writes (payments, publishing, imports, data deletion), and anything the
   roadmap marks as in-flight or recently shipped (new code, least battle-tested).
   Present your pick with a one-line reason each, and let the user adjust
   (AskUserQuestion, with your pick as the recommended option).
3. **No foundation docs:** ask the user for 2–3 areas to review
   full-stack (AskUserQuestion). Offer 3–4 concrete candidates you inferred
   from the route/page/module structure, so they are not answering blind.

**Rotation on reruns.** If earlier reports exist, prefer flows they did not
cover, or covered at an older commit, and say so ("login and CMS were
audited on 2026-09-24; this run proposes checkout and notifications").
The user can still choose to re-audit the same areas; the report then
records how each earlier finding changed.

### Step 3 — Fan out the audits (parallel subagents)

Launch in a single message, so they run concurrently:

- **One auditor per area** (read-only).
- **One plumbing auditor** (read-only). It covers the cross-cutting pieces
  no area owns: tracker init, boundaries and middleware order, the
  logger's error serialization, scrubbing hooks, deploy identity,
  background/worker processes, client-side global handlers, platform log
  and alert config, plus a repo-wide sweep with counts.

Use the briefs in `references/auditor-briefs.md`. Paste the capture model
from Step 1 into every brief, together with any known issues from earlier
reports or triage docs. Classify every finding with the taxonomy and
severity rubric in `references/gap-taxonomy.md`, so that area results merge
cleanly.

While they run, prepare Step 4 if it applies.

### Step 4 — Runtime proof (optional, isolated)

Static reading says "this *should* be invisible". A runtime probe shows it
is. Offer this step when the audit found critical coverage gaps and the app
can boot locally. Run it when the user passed `--runtime` or agreed.

Follow `references/runtime-probes.md`. The essentials:

- Work in an **isolated copy only**: a git worktree (the subagent's
  `isolation: "worktree"` option) or a temp clone. Never touch the main tree,
  never commit, never push, never deploy.
- Point the error tracker at a **local fake ingest endpoint**
  (`scripts/fake-ingest.mjs`) instead of the real service. Never send probe
  events to a production tracker, and never use production databases or
  third-party accounts.
- Inject a fixed catalog of failure shapes (thrown in handler, thrown in
  early middleware, error returned as a 5xx without throwing, ignored error
  result, unhandled rejection, background task failure, error object passed
  to the logger…) with a probe trigger (e.g. `?probe=<id>`). Record HTTP
  result / platform console output / what reached the fake tracker.
- Script the run (`suite` script), so it can be repeated identically.
  Keeping the harness is what makes before/after proof possible later.

If the app cannot boot (missing infra, secrets, paid services), report the
exact blocker. Mark the affected findings as *static-only*; never guess
runtime results.

### Step 5 — Verify, then synthesize

Subagents over-report. Before the report:

- **Spot-check** the 3–5 most surprising or most severe claims yourself
  (read the cited lines, run the regex, check the SDK source in the
  dependency folder). Drop or downgrade anything that doesn't hold, and say
  in the report that you verified it.
- **Deduplicate** across areas. Several area findings are often one
  mechanism: "12 routes don't call the reporter" is *one* coverage gap with
  12 locations, not 12 findings.
- **Name the systemic root causes** (usually 3–6). These are the most
  valuable part of the report, because fixing one root cause closes many
  findings.
- **Order the fixes** by blindness removed per unit of effort. Wide-coverage
  plumbing fixes (one global boundary, logger serialization, scrubbing
  scope, release tagging) usually come before local ones.

### Step 6 — Write the report (new file every run)

Write to `context/audits/observability/<YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM>-<areas-slug>.md`
using `references/report-template.md`. Create the directory if needed.

- **Never overwrite or edit an earlier report.** If the path exists, add
  `-2`, `-3`. Earlier reports are the history that later runs compare
  against.
- The report's frontmatter records the run identity, areas, mode, runtime
  proof status and a link to the previous report. The next run relies on
  that frontmatter, so keep its keys stable.
- If a previous report exists, fill **Changes since last audit**: for each
  earlier finding in an area you covered again, mark it `fixed`, `still
  open`, `changed` or `not re-checked`, with evidence.
- Keep each finding to its location, its category, its severity, **what
  happens in production when it fails**, and a one-line fix direction. The
  production consequence is what makes a finding actionable, so never leave
  it out.

### Step 7 — Hand off

Tell the user, in a few lines: the report path, the top 3 root causes, the
count of findings by severity, what was runtime-proven vs static-only, and
the recommended first fix. Offer next steps:

- prove a specific fix with a before/after run on the same probe suite
  (see *Verify mode*);
- turn the top fix into a change with `/10x-new` + `/10x-plan`.

Mention that isolated worktrees or harness files from Step 4 still exist,
and where. Don't delete them without asking, because they are needed for
before/after proof.

## Verify mode (`--verify <report>`)

Use this after fixes land, or to prove a proposed fix works. Read the given
report and re-check each finding: re-read the cited code, and, if the report
has a probe harness, re-run the same suite. Produce a new dated report with
`mode: verify` whose body is mainly **Changes since last audit** and a
before/after table. The same probe catalog before and after is what turns
"we think it's fixed" into evidence.

## Principles

- **Coverage first, then fidelity, then noise.** A failure the tracker never
  sees matters more than one it sees without a stack, which matters more
  than one it sees too often.
- **Judge by what a responder would get.** For each gap, ask what an
  on-call engineer would see at 3 a.m.: an alert? an issue with a stack and
  the user/route/entity? a log line they would need to already know to
  search for? nothing?
- **Graceful degradation needs its own signal.** Fallbacks that keep users
  unblocked are good. Fallbacks that also remove the only sign of the outage
  are findings.
- **Privacy is a constraint, not an excuse.** Recommend fixes that keep
  scrubbing working (hash or id instead of email, keep error names/codes and
  stacks, drop only the values). Never recommend sending PII.
- **Stack-agnostic wording.** Describe mechanisms ("route opts out of the
  reporting wrapper"), then the concrete local API. The taxonomy works for
  any language or framework.
