# Mapping a skill

Before the worker starts, the observer reads the target skill and writes its
**map**: the skill's anatomy as an ordered list of nodes. The map is what the
user learns from; the worker's trace only shows where in the map the run is.

## What to read

The target's `SKILL.md`, plus any file it says to follow as part of its
workflow (templates, sub-procedures under `references/`). Skip examples and
long reference tables unless they change the flow.

## Schema

```json
{
  "summary": "One sentence: what the skill turns what input into.",
  "nodes": [
    { "id": "fanout", "title": "Research areas in parallel", "pattern": "fan-out",
      "concept": "Why this step exists and what technique it uses.",
      "parent": "<id of an earlier node, for loop/fan-out bodies>",
      "when": "<condition, for branches and optional gates>" }
  ]
}
```

`pattern` is one of:

| pattern | use for |
|---|---|
| `input` | taking in args, named files, the user's request |
| `context` | loading priors: lessons, foundation docs, config, memory |
| `decompose` | splitting work into areas, phases, tasks |
| `gate` | a human decision point (AskUserQuestion, approval, wait for reply) |
| `fan-out` | spawning parallel sub-agents |
| `loop` | repeating a body per phase/item/round until a condition holds |
| `branch` | a step that only runs under a condition (give `when`) |
| `synthesize` | merging results, ranking evidence, drawing conclusions |
| `artifact` | writing the skill's output file(s) |
| `verify` | tests, checks, gates that can send the run back |
| `handoff` | presenting results, pointing at the next skill |
| `step` | anything else |

## Language

Write `summary`, every `title`, `concept` and `when` in the run's language
(`--lang`: `pl` = Polish, `en` = English). Ids and `pattern` stay as in the
schema.

## Writing good nodes

- **6–12 top-level nodes.** Merge trivial steps; split a step only when the
  halves teach different ideas. Children (`parent`) are for the body of a
  `loop` or the lanes of a `fan-out`, one level deep.
- **Follow the skill's real order and control flow,** not its section
  headings. A "repeat for each phase" paragraph is a `loop` node with
  children, even if the skill numbers it as one step. Optional gates and
  conditional steps get `when`.
- **`title`**: what the step does, in plain words, ≤ 45 characters.
- **`concept`**: 1–2 sentences answering "why did the author put this step
  here?": what would go wrong for an agent without it (finite context, no
  memory between sessions, confident guessing, self-declared success…) and
  how this step answers it in *this* skill. The views already show each
  pattern's general lesson the first time it appears, so don't repeat it:
  name what is specific (which files, which agents, which question, which
  check). Plain words over jargon. Don't restate the title, and don't
  predict this run's outcome.
- **Never spoil the run.** The map describes the skill, not what it will find.
  Nodes are revealed one by one as the worker reaches them; only the count of
  steps is visible upfront.
- **ids** are short kebab-case and stable; the worker tags events with them.

See `example-map-10x-research.json` for a worked map.
